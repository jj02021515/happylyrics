        <h2><strong>More Than a Friend by GIRLI</strong></h2>
        <p>
            I met her when I was still with my ex,but<br>
            Her lipstick was blood red,<br>
            She wore her hair messed up<br>
            she was my best friend when<br>
            I had a boyfriend<br>
            But she was on my mind<br>
            When I was in his bed<br>

            <hr>
            So we kept in touch 'cause I<br>
            Wanted to touch her<br>
            I got kinda drunk and told her<br>
            that i liked her<br>
            she said, "You're the best,"this<br>
            girl has got me all messed up<br>
            Up, up<br>
            'Cause<br>
            <hr>

            When she bites her lip,looks<br>
            at me like that<br>
            I wanna be more than a<br>
            friend, more than a friend<br>
            Does she feel the same?<br>
            Does she want me back? <br>
            I wanna be more than a friend<br>
            I have you close but i wnat <br>
            more<br>
            I want your T-shirt on the floor<br>
            When you bite your lip,look<br>
            at me like that<br>
            I wanna be more than a<br>
            friend, more than a friend<br>
            (More than a friend)<br>
            <hr>

            So fucking confusing the way<br>
            that she texts me<br>
            Keeps saying, "I love you,"<br>
            wish she really meant it(Hey,I<br>
            love you)<br>
            Sometimes she comes over,<br>
            we call it a girl's night<br>
            When she takes her clothes<br>
            off, I know that she's my type<br>
            (oh my god)<br>
